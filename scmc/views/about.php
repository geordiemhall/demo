				<h3>What's an ARG?</h3>
				<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">alternate reality game</a> (ARG) is a game that takes place in the real world, using transmedia to create and deliver a story or experience to players. Or something like that.</p>
				
				<h3>But what's the actual game?</h3>
				<p>Sponge Cake Monster Clash is a game about monsters. It takes place over the next four weeks, and is a combination of live events and scavenger hunts.</p>

				<h3>Is there a story?</h3>
				<p>Yes. George Swinburne created four monsters by accident, and was powerless when their lust for sponge cake grew great. As they terrorised the city he watched on in horror, realising that he had to do something or they would destroy each other.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h3>What are the live events?</h3>
				<p>Every Thursday at 12.30pm in the Swinburne Atrium (between the Library and BA Building) we'll be holding a live event, where you'll get to talk at, stare at, and maybe pat the monsters. There'll be games to play, fun to have, and maybe even some sponge cake to throw.</p>
				<p><a href="/get-involved">Find out more</a> about our events.</p>

				<h3>But what are these envelopes I keep seeing?</h3>
				<p>In addition to the live events, there are a number of envelopes hidden throughout Swinburne University. Each envelope contains a diary entry written by George Swinburne himself, creator of monsters. Diary entries will be posted on our website as the game progresses, and will reveal the story of just how the monsters came to be, and how they became so obsessed with the cake of sponge.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h3>Wait, how do I get to throw some sweet, sweet sponge cake?</h3>
				<p>Well we never promised that! Wink wink. Maybe if you showed up to our last live event there might be some spongy goodness to dazzle your senses.</p>
				<p>There'll be more than just cake though. Think water bombs. And human snake. And a monster tug.</p>


				<h3>Well when is it?</h3>
				<p>Sound like you wanna join in. And so do all of your friends (trust us).</p>
				<p>It's <strong>12:30pm</strong> every for the next four <strong>Thursdays</strong>, in the <strong>Atrium</strong> at Swinburne. More info can be found <a href="/get-involved">here.</a></p>
				<p>And tell your friends to bring their friends too. Srsly.</p>
