					Screech's bone-chilling squaking has kept me up all night again; I fear its hunger for sponge cake will never abate.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					I still sometimes doubt myself in my decision to create mutated creatures that hunger for cake, but then I remember why I did what I did; it's just hilarious to watch them roll around and fight for sponge cake
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Spooky has seemingly gained the ability to devour cake with the same ferocity of the other creatures, I wonder how this will affect the outcome of the next clash
				</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Today I found Swampy concealing an improvised fork made from a toothbrush, which I attempted taking from him with disastrous results. It appears his lust for cake has created an intelligence far greater than I expected...
				</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Screech has now increased to 5 sponge cakes daily. With all my other monsters to take care of, I'm not sure how I long I can keep these monsters satisfied.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					I tried experimenting with a two-versus-two monster clash... I now realize that teamwork isn't a high priority for these monsters.

					Poor Spooky. After his battle with Shivers and a reward of 2 sponge cakes, it turns out even a ghost can bleed! <del>Don’t misrepresent me, that’s not what happened at all.</del>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Scary the Scarecrow has been one of the least effective monsters so far. Yet he complains about not getting spongecake. If i wanted to deal with this sort of behavior i would of had children by now.

			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Shivers, when can I see you next? You give me chills. Multiplying chills.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Spooky has made himself a friend with the model skeleton I have in my science room. He gets quite defensive whenever I approach to try to move it. <del>You people just can’t grasp that the object of the game is to not rattle his bones.</del>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>
					Spooky isn’t very fond of Shivers. Often he will get him in a headlock or attempt to remove his fingers <del>if he points at me one more time</del>.

					Sponge... cake... moar...
