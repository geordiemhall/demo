		<h1>Spooky</h1>
		<p><strong>Identification Code:</strong> 426</p>
		<p><strong>Interaction Procedures:</strong> Those wishing to approach Spooky for research or training purposes should be warned that it looks very convincing, and that merely laying eyes on it <del>probably won’t could</del> <strong>will</strong> result in a severe spooking of the viewer.</p>
		<p><strong>Description:</strong> Spooky cannot communicate in English, and rarely says anything <del>unless its actor is in a bad mood</del>. It has an appearance that of a man wearing a white sheet, which researchers have found to be "totally the intention". Spooky is also inseparable from the black top hat it wears, with the only successful removal resulting in shedding its spectral appearance and attacking <del>that bastard who took my hat</del> the researcher. It is currently unknown why a spectre would be interested in sponge cake.</p>
		<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Due to <del>the costume's</del> its lack of weight, it is quite agile. Also, quite perceptive.</p>
		<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> <del>I</del> Spooky reacts poorly to objects being thrown at <del>me</del> <strong>it</strong>, and will evade and if possible return the offending object <del>because I warned you what would happen if you kept doing that</del>.</p>

<!-- Scary -->

		</span>
		<h1>Scary</h1>
		<p><strong>Identification Code:</strong> 173</p>
		<p><strong>Interaction procedures:</strong> Scary’s imposing presence can be quite misleading, as deep down he is incredibly intelligent and an emotional individual. It’s advised to never trust him, and always approach with caution as constant neglect has left him with a bad temper. Communication may also be difficult due to his mouth being sealed shut.</p>
		<p><strong>Description:</strong> Scary resulted from a mishap in the genetics lab, in which a straw hat was accidentally left on a pile of clothes and then exposed to extreme radiation. The objects coalesced over time, combining to form one hideous, mutated specimen. The creature resembles a scarecrow, is incapable of communicating or expressing himself, and is only able to speak via inaudible grunts and mumbles. Despite his shortcomings he is still able to manipulate others to do his will and should never be trusted. His sealed mouth renders him unable to consume cake, which he loves for no reason.</p>
		<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Very resourceful and can make great use of his surroundings. Has exceptional intellect and intelligence.</p>
		<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Hasty and impatient. Weak genetic structure renders him susceptible to fire water. Will follow any girl with a dog without a second thought.</p>

<!-- Shivers -->
<section class="green monster">

		</span>
		<h1>Shivers</h1>
		<p><strong>Identification Code:</strong> 682</p>
		<p><strong>Interaction procedures:</strong> A distance of 2 meters or greater should be maintained at all times. The creature appears to exhibit what may be called a short temper, and the only sure thing to abate that, is the liberal application of water, preferably through the apparatus of balloons filled water - as one does not get too close, lest one's clothes are dirtied.</p>
		<p><strong>Description:</strong> From the pitch black choking bogs of South America it was captured by a small hunting team, and brought to the masters of monster research at Swinburne University. The change from the sticky heat of the wet jungles to the winters of Melbourne occasionally proves too much for it, and so it begins to shake and Shiver. The origin of it's evolution is not known, and could prove to be the missing link between humanoid and amphibian, but for now it has freed itself from the lab. It runs amok on the busy alleyways of Swinburne University. It is known that it enjoys cake, the reason has been lost in the need to abate it. Take care as you traverse between classes.</p>
		<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Very fast, strong and agile. It is very competent at using weapons.</p>
		<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Hot-headed, short tempered, easily provoked and manipulated.</p>

<!-- Screech -->
<section class="orange monster">
	<div class="container">
		<span class="portrait">
			<img src="/img/monsters/screech-feature.png" width="442" height="585">
		</span>
		<h1>Screech</h1>
		<p><strong>Identification Code:</strong> 3467</p>
		<p><strong>Interaction Procedures:</strong> Screech has a very sharp beak and will bite you with it if it gets agitated enough, but prefers throwing objects at its victims, namely cakes and pies. Participants are advised not to approach Screech.</p>
		<p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject is the result of a biogenetics splicing project. It has the DNA of a human and a chicken. Screech possesses intelligence that is arguably equivalent to a human but does not have vocal human chords, and therefore cannot communicate. Instead, it prefers to screech at people. After signing up to study video games in university, Screech was left disillusioned and frustrated when it instead had to produce an embarrassing experimental marketing project. Since then, Screech has broken bad and is taking out his anger and malice on innocent bystanders.</p>
		<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Quick, intelligent, agile. Sharp beak and claws make it formidable in unarmed combat. Often carries projectiles to throw at bystanders.</p>
		<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Fragile skeleton allows vulnerability to blunt force trauma.</p>
