				<h2><s>Week 1</s></h2>
				<p>Water bombs flew free and fast as our monsters assembled. We played a horribly intense, disgustingly fun, unbelievably engaging game of <i>Monster!</i>, and spread the word about the upcoming clash.</p><p>We were also shut down by some pleasant security guards, but they won't scare the monsters off for long!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span3">
				<h2><s>Week 2</s></h2>
				<p>The weather she was a rainin'. And we all know how much monsters hate rain: there's literally nothing worse than wet sponge cake. Yuck.</p><p><i>Moist</i> cake, now that's a different story. Mosters may look scary, hungry, and utterly uncontrollable, but even they put safety first.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span3">
				<h2>Week 3</h2>
				<p>We have tons planned, so come along to find out what will happen!</p>
				<p class="muted">(Water bombs are a safe bet)</p>

			<div class="span3">
				<h2>Week 4</h2>
				<p>The final week will be amazing. Srsly. There'll be real cake, real clashes, and real fun. We guarantee the first two! The monsters promise. </p><p>And when a monster makes a promise, it's a promise for life. They're actually very loyal, you know.</p>
