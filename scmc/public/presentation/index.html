          <section>
            <p>The game proved popular. Why?</p>
            <p class="l">A mashing of carnival games where objects are thrown at a target</p>

            <p>Finally, we actually organised stuff. </p>
            <p class="l">The budget was spent on props and marketing.</p>
            <p>It rained</p>
            <p class="l">And we were told to move outside</p>
            <p>But we had a cake city.</p>

          <section>
            <p>It was the right decision to focus on the location-based stuff</p>
            <p class="l">We were much more motivated, and had more fun making it</p>
            <p>But logistics made it very difficult to execute</p>

            <p>Leadership was an issue at times</p>

            <p>Communication was poor for most of the project</p>

          <section>
            <p>There wasn't a whole lot for most people to do</p>
            <p class="l">Was that because of poor delegation?</p>
            <p class="l">Lack of leadership?</p>
