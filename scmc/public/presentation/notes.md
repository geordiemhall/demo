Problems:

- We changed our concept early on, which meant we had to throw out a lot of work
- We changed our concept in the middle, to focus on the strengths
- Communication was a problem, particularly in the few weeks after Brendan left
- Eventually we worked out a leadership structure that worked for us, 



# Original Concept
    - The old game - entropy
    - how we had the old thing, changed it into SCMC
    - we thought this would be more entertaining, and it excited the team
    - as a serious joke we pitched SCMC


# Sponge Cake Monster Clash
    - we started with elements of the old game
    - more ARG based
    - We had extra characters, puzzles and riddles to solve online, trails to follow and an overarching narrative structure
    - Characters such as George Swinburne, Monash, OShare. 
    - They would hide clues and interact with players, giving them game artifacts and problems to solve to further the story
    - similar to eden
    - Troy even said that our two games were similar

# Problems
    - communication was an issue
    - producer left
    - idea wasn't fully understood, there was no shared vision
    - disparate groups were working in isolation, no collaboration 
    - the old mechanics were conflicting with our new ideas, and made it difficult to have a cohesive structure and player experience

# The solution
    - we solved this by focusing on the strengths of the concept
    - The monsters, the sponge cake, the absurdity
    - We changed it to be a multi event location-based pervasive game
    - inspired by pop-up playground
    - Instead of focusing on narrative, puzzles and additional characters, we focused on the monsters
    - They were the interesting characters all along, and would lend themselves well to event-driven gameplay
    - We changed the story-based diary entries into promotional tools, and hide them on the day of the event, also handing them out to players
    - The gameplay itself could be quite trivial as long as meaning of the interactions is strong

# More problems
- Once we had the format locked down, more problems arose
- Booking the space was a hassle
- Limited budget, we couldn't evenly distribute it or there would be no money for the final event
- No communication on whether the booking was successful, often the morning of, made it hard to plan


# Events
- With each event we learned more, and it's a shame there wasn't more time to improve
- 
- First event started slowly, but once we moved out and found a crowd things started to look up it was shut down by law enforcement
- Weather rained out the second event
- The third event was good, and we once again played the monster gallery game, later coined 'Monster Splash'
- This type on interation is a mashing of carnival games where objects are thrown at a target, if hit the clown is dunked in water, and carnival freakshows
- People loved it, and we actually had a decent-sized crowd forming

# Reflection
- It was the right decision to focus on the location stuff
- But logistics made it very difficult to execute, particularly with our inexperience in event organisation
